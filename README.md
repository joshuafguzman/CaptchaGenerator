# CaptchaGenerator

This project was made in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and it was made to catch bots by having a user type info into a text box. 
The all input will be added to a txt file and be displayed in the JavaScript console. The project will also display the time and the typing speed.
It will display if the captcha was entered correctly or incorrectly and the user can refresh to display a different captcha.
