Design for Project

1. I tried to make the project in python but decided to change it to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
2. I looked on ways to look up Bot detection tools.
3. Decided on a Captcha.
4. Created the page and decided to add page color changer 
5. After a while I removed the color changer.
6. Added the characters per minute and input into the console.
7. Added time to console and input into a txt file.
